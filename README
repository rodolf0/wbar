===================
      wbar
===================

Dependencies:
-------------
imlib2-dev

General:
--------
wbar is a quick launch bar. Its fast, light and cool eye-candy.

Its hacked in c++ trying to keep code as readable as possible
with out sacrificing speed. It works directly on top of X to avoid
going throug a lot of layers.

Initially developed for Fluxbox, then tested on WindowMaker, Xfce, 
Gnome, etc.

Since version 1.0 can run on top of desktops such as xfdesktop 
or nautilus with the -above-desk switch.


Installing: (for the impacient)
-----------

$ make

As root
# make install

As the user who's gonna run the wbar
this should create appropiate files for running

$ make config

$ wbar -help (this gives you important options)

Now wbar should work out of the box(, but again ... may be not).

Notes:
------
* If you're getting window decorations (you shouldn't) when you start
  your window manager because you're using the -above-desk switch, 
  try to give the WM some time to start up before wbar does. 

  Example (in your startup script): (sleep 5s && wbar) &
  Note that the parenthesis surrounding the command are important.

Fonts:
------
Font support is new. Its used to display text below the icons.
To change font color / shadow / position you'll have
to hack into the code which shouldn't be dificult at all.
TODO: Fix wide labels, chopped when rendering as vertical bar.


Configuration file:
-------------------
If not supplied $HOME/.wbar will be tried, 
else dot.wbar at $PWD, else /usr/share/wbar/dot.wbar

.wbar format:
---------------
Commented lines start whith #.
Blank lines are ignored.

Example file: dot.wbar 

Each icon has the following format:

i: <icon-file-path>
c: <command to execute on click>
t: <text to display on mouse over>

The order of appearance doesn't matter but all 3 of these lines must
appear. If you aren't gonna display text nor have a command associated
for a certain icon you should do the following:

i: <icon-file-path>
c: 
t: 


The first icon definition has a special meaning:
------------------------------------------------
i: <path-to-the-bar-background-image>
c: --
t: <path-to-font-to-display-text-with/size>

IF A FONT ISN'T SUPPLIED THEN NO TEXT RENDERING IS DONE.

*******************

Filters:
--------
-fc set the filter color which is applied to icons.
The format is 0xAARRGGBB

-filter controls where to apply filter 
0: dont apply 
1: apply to hovered icon 
2: apply to all but hovered 
3: all

experiment with other options.

BUGS:
----
You gotta be joking. :-)

Fix them man ! I need a hand to keep this alive.
