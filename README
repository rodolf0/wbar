General:
--------
Wbar is a quick launch bar inspired on superkaramba's tux-bar.
Its only reuirements are imlib2.

This is eye candy developed in C++. The motivation is to run as 
fast as possible but probably it can still be made faster.

Tested succesfully on Fluxbox, WindowMaker.

Since version 1.0 can run on top of desktops such as xfdesktop 
or nautilus with the -above-desk switch.


Installing: (for the impacient)
-----------

$ make

As root
# make install

As the user who's gonna run the wbar
this should create appropiate files for running

$ make config

$ wbar -help

Now wbar should work out of the box(, but again ... may be not).

Notes:
------
* If you're getting window decorations (you shouldn't) when you start
  your window manager because you're using the -above-desk switch, 
  try to give the WM some time to start up before wbar does. 
  Example (in your startup script): sleep 5s && wbar &

Fonts:
------
Font support is new. Its used to display text below the icons.
To change font color / shadow / position you'll have
to hack into the code which shouldn't be dificult at all.
TODO: Fix wide labels, chopped when rendering as vertical bar.


Configuration file:
-------------------
If not supplied $HOME/.wbar will be used, 
else dot.wbar at $PWD, else /usr/local/share/wbar/dot.wbar

.wbar format:
---------------
Commented lines start whith #.
Blank lines are ignored.

Example file: dot.wbar 

Each icon has the following format:

i: <icon-file-path>
c: <command to execute on click>
t: <text to display on mouse over>

The order of appearance doesn't matter but all 3 of these lines must
appear. If you aren't gonna display text nor have a command associated
for a certain icon you should do the following:

i: <icon-file-path>
c: 
t: 


The first icon definition has a special meaning:
------------------------------------------------
i: <path-to-the-bar-background-image>
c: --
t: <path-to-font-to-display-text-with/size>

IF A FONT ISN'T SUPPLIED THEN NO TEXT RENDERING IS DONE.

*******************
If you aren't going to use fonts you should change the following line in Makefile:

CXXFLAGS=`imlib2-config --cflags` -Wall -O2 -DDOCKWIN -DCOOLMACHINE_N_SHITCODE
Change for this one:
CXXFLAGS=`imlib2-config --cflags` -Wall -O2 -DDOCKWIN

which should make things imperceptiblly faster.
*******************

Filters:
--------
-fr -fg -fb -fa set the filter color which is applied to icons

-filter controls where to apply filter 
0: dont apply 
1: apply to hovered icon 
2: apply to all but hovered 
3: all

experiment with other options.

BUGS:
----
* non existing options will segfault
